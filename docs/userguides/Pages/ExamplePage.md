# Example Page
<!-- ToDo: This is a template meant to be copied and filled in with the particulars of each page type. Update or remove the text in (brackets) below to keep docs as consistent and concise as possible. -->

(Example) Pages are (meant for This Use Case) (and usually sit under Other Page Type).

<!-- Include a screenshot of a sample page. If some elements are only displayed at certain breakpoints (e.g. a sidebar on desktop only), use a screenshot for each breakpoint with a change; otherwise just one screenshot, probably desktop. -->

(Example) pages have the following fields: 
<!-- Note: Other than Page name, avoid including fields that are universal across all project page types, i.e. if it's described in your Global Page Features, skip it here (e.g. URL segment, navigation, and any custom fields added to all pages in your project). -->
* **Page name**: The title of the page (and any specifics to how it is used on this particular page type). (Required./Optional.)
* **Another field**: (Description.) (Required./Optional.)
* **Another field**: (Description.) (Required./Optional.)
<!-- If relevant, include things like character limits, image type requirements &etc, directly copy-pasting the CMS setDescription fields if that's easiest. -->

<!-- To avoid duplication, for things like links, menus, etc, say "see **Site Tools > Links** for details" and only explain details unique to this use (if any, e.g. if this use of the Link module has a custom field for Button vs Text link, etc). -->

<!-- If there are a lot of fields in multiple tabs, split up the list by tabs. Otherwise keep the fields in the order they appear scrolling down the CMS page. -->

<!-- Avoid CMS screenshots unless it is very hard for users to find the fields by name alone. -->
