# Header

<!-- ToDo: As headers vary a lot across projects, this file is mostly structure with text based on common header practice: Update as appropriate for your project -->

The Header sits at the top of every page, and contains:
* **(item)**: (description)
<!-- e.g. the site logo, the search button, &etc. Use this list just to name them, and make sections below to explain how to configure each. -->

<!-- Include screenshots of the Header; if some elements are only displayed at certain breakpoints, use a screenshot for each breakpoint with a change; otherwise just one screenshot, probably desktop. -->


<!-- Examples from common features: 
## Logo

The logo is a link to the home page, on every page except the home page. It needs no CMS configuration.


## Search button

Pressing the search icon (magnifying glass) will open the search overlay.

(Screenshot of search overlay)

The user can enter a search term and on submit will navigate to the search page with the term pre-filled in.

Clicking on the close or x icon in the top right corner will close the overlay.

<!-- Most headers use the Menu Manager module for links; if this project does so, use the following to redirect readers to the page on menu management, rather than describing it in detail here:

Each item is controlled by a menu sets in the the Menu Manager; see** Information Management > Menus and Menu** sets below for details on how menu sets work. 
* The (link group 1) is controlled by the (link group 1 menu set name) menu set.
* The (link group 2) is controlled by the (link group 2 menu set name) menu set.

These menu sets have some custom fields: 
* (describe any modifications to the menu sets that apply only to Header menu sets)
