# Blocks

Blocks are chunks of content than are added to pages, in any order, and make up most of the content on any page.

Some blocks are only allowed on certain page types.

## Creating, Editing, and Deleting Blocks
To add any block to a page, click the green Add Block button. The available block types will appear in a popup list.

Blocks are listed in the same order they appear on a page, and can be drag-and-dropped to rearrange them.

To edit a block, press its title; it will either expand or open a new page to show the available fields. Add or edit content as needed, and press Save or Publish. 

Note: Blocks with any unpublished changes, including rearranged positions, will have a small red circle on their icon.

To remove a content block, click the dots to the right of the Publish button and select Archive. 

## Global Block Features

Blocks have a wide variety of features that vary depending on what the block does, but some features are universal.

* **Title**: Nearly all blocks will have a Title field, which are used as labels in a pages list of blocks. Once a block title is added and saved, it will appear on the collapsed block in the page list. If no title has been saved, it will be called "_Untitled [block name] block_".
* **"Displayed" checkbox**: Some title fields will have a checkbox marked "Displayed: next to them. Check this box to make the block title appear at the top of the block on the public published page. 

<!-- ToDo: Add any other fields that are universal across all blocks, including any in the Settings tab. -->
