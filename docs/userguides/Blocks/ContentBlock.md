# Content Blocks

The most basic block is the standard Content Block, which has the following fields:

* **Title**: The title of the block, which will be its label in the CMS. If the Displayed checkbox is ticked, the title will also appear as a heading at the top of the block.
* **Content**: A rich text editor that can take large amounts of text, links, tables, and images or other media. See **Site Tools > Rich Text Editor** for details.
