# Example Block
<!-- ToDo: This is a template meant to be copied and filled in with the particulars of each block. Update or remove the text in (brackets) below to keep docs as consistent and concise as possible. -->

The (Example) Block (briefly describe intended use) and (is only allowed on These Page Types / is a restricted/full-width block).

(Include a screenshot of a sample block. If some elements are only displayed at certain breakpoints, use a screenshot for each breakpoint with a change; otherwise just one screenshot, probably desktop.)


(Example) blocks have the following fields: 
* **Title**: (Describe whether the title appears on the front-end, and anything else that isn't obvious from the above screenshot.) (Required.)
* **Another field**: (Description.) (Required./Optional.)
* **Another field**: (Description.) (Required./Optional.)
<!-- If relevant, include things like character limits, image type requirements &etc, directly copy-pasting the CMS setDescription fields if that's easiest. -->

<!-- To avoid duplication, for things like links, menus, etc, say "see **Site Tools > Links** for details" and only explain details unique to this use (if any, e.g. if this use of the Link module has a custom field for Button vs Text link, etc). -->

<!-- Avoid CMS screenshots unless it is very hard for users to find the fields by name alone. -->
