# Introduction

Welcome to the User Guide!

These documents outline how to use all the custom features of your website. 

Major sections:
* **Global Features**: All site-wide features such as the header, footer, navigation menus and alert banners.
* **Page Types**: Everything you need to know about adding and editing pages, and all the fine details of each custom page type.
* **Blocks**: Everything you need to know about adding and editing blocks to pages, and all the fine details of each custom block.
* **Site Tools**: These tools, such as Links, Rich Text/WYSIWYG editors, and File management, are used throughout the site; this section walks through the default uses of each.
* **Information Management**: Some of your site data is not stored on a single page or block, but is used on many features, pages or blocks, such as menus and tags. This section illustrates how to handle that data for each section. <!-- ToDo: Edit this line to remove inaccurate descriptions, e.g. if there is no menu manager or tags/taxonomies in the site. -->
